All documentation beginning with the preliminary studies and including the contract itself should be published, through the Public Procurement Electronic System (SECOP). By visiting the website http://www.colombiacompra.gov.co/ users can access contracts closed in the past two years.\n However there are some limitations to the system. Extractives contracts are presently excluded from the system. In addition a self-evaluation done by the Intersectoral Commission of Public Contracting (CINCO) in 2008 also mentions problems related to full coverage of the system, due to lack of connectivity in some areas. Furthermore CGD’s research found that some contracts of concern appear to have been taken down from. For example there are limited contracts available related to the Bogotá Transmilenio Project which was at the centre of a contracting scandal.",
